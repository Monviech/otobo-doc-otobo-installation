For now we only consider the most simple case, where the backup dir is a local dir on the Docker host. The location of the backup dir in the container can be arbitrarily chosen. In this example we choose the local dir ``otobo_backup`` as the location on the host, and ``/otobo_backup`` as the location in the container."
